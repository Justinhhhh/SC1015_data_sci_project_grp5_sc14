## About 

Welcome to SC14 Group 5's repository! This repository contains the codebase and dataset of the Mini-Project completed for the module INTRO TO DATA SCI & ART INTELL (SC1015).

## Problem Definition

- Can we predict the diameters of asteroids?
- Can we predict if an asteroid poses a threat?

## Models Used

1. Linear Regression - diameter prediction
2. Logistic Regression - to classify if an asteroid is a hazard
3. XGBoost - to classify if an asteroid is a hazard

## Outcomes
We have learned how to use new models, which include:
-	Logistic Regression
-	XGBoost

We have also learned new methods, such as:
-	Scaling
-	Skewness Correction
-	Class Balancing
-	Cross Validation

We have also used a new evaluation metric:
-	ROC-AUC

We have learnt that:
1.	Skewness correction does not always improve the performance of the model, but it can sometimes.
2.	How to select features to simplify models.
3.	The importance of data cleaning. We have dropped more than half of the original features as they were redundant.
